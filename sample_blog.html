    <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
    <br>
    <section>
      The lone lamp post of the one-street town flickered, not quite dead but definitely on its way out. Suitcase by her
      side, she paid no heed to the light, the street or the town. A car was coming down the street and with her arm
      outstretched and thumb in the air, she had a plan. She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get
      through. "You need to learn to think for yourself," she wanted to tell him. "Your friends are holding you back and
      bringing you down." But she didn't because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life
      of misery, he would never give them up.

    <b>MAIN CONTENT</b>
    <br>
    <section>
      Her mom had warned her. She had been warned time and again, but she had refused to believe her. She had done
      everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion. So when the promotion was
      given
      to her main rival, it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray. It was her first big lesson in
      life,
      but not the last. The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While
      many
      of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It
      wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into
      history.So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be
      discovered hundreds of years in the future.It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you
      happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the
      lesson they were about to learn that day.
      <br><br>

      Don't be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the
      moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less scary place
      for you. Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, he quietly listened to those
      who
      roamed by. He felt at peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an
      end. He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he
      could remember.There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails
      on the table. A person chewing with their mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. She
      couldn't stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldn't stand which
      topped all of them combined.She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but
      her mom had insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to
      appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she
      wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.
      She didn't understand how changed worked. When she looked at today compared to yesterday, there was nothing that
      she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year, she couldn't see how
      anything was ever the same.
      Eating raw fish didn't sound like a good idea. "It's a delicacy in Japan," didn't seem to make it any more
      appetizing. Raw fish is raw fish.
      <br><br>

      It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned
      over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and
      prepare.His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to them since they refused to believe
      the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There
      was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden.
      Of course, it didn't help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain
      once again how he'd found it.There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her
      life, but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that
      could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you
      did.

    <b>FINAL CLOSURE</b>
    <br>
    <section>
      A long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five Venusians, very much startled, looked
      overhead. They were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign
      atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information "Pepsi-Cola."She tried to explain that love wasn't
      like pie. There wasn't a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn't less to be given to one person if you
      wanted to give more to another. That after a set amount was given out it would all disappear. She tried to explain
      this, but it fell on deaf ears.I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the
      weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here
      for the birthday if possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight
      plans.
